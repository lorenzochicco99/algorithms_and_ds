# Data Structures and Algorithms resources

I created this repository to share the notebooks I made while studying Data Structures and Algorithms at Universit√† di Trento. 

I'm using Agarwal book for the theory while the Grookins book to get the algorithms intuition, atm I'm not integrating slides from the professor.

## Prerequisites
- <b>Mandatory</b>: Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter extension on Visual studio Code
- <b>Recommended</b>: Install Git to get updates daily. Clone the repository and run "git fetch" periodicaly

## Structure
- notes (ipynb files in the main folder) these are the notes
- books: containing the books I have used for the notebooks
- img: containing all the images in the notebooks (not useful)
- lab: containing all the laboratory exercises

## Books involved
- Agarwal: Hands on Data Structures and Algorithms with Python
- Grookins: An illustrated guide for programmers and other

## Programme

## Work
#### Finished Work
- (1) Algorithm Analysis: asymptotic notations
- (6) Algorithms Techniques: recursion, divide-et-impera, dynamic programming and binary search
- (2) Sorting Algorithms: merge sort, insertion sort, <u>selection sort, quick sort </u>

#### Currently Working on
- (3) Data Structures: sequence, maps, sets, stack, queue </u>

## Exporting the Work in pdf/html
It is possible to export the notebooks in pdf or html files using Jupyter Notebook, through the "Export" command

- Visual Studio Code: Click the three dots on the upped command bar (next to Outline) --> Export
- Jupyter Notebook: Click on File --> Download as..
